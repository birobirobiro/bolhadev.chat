# Bolhadev.chat

Brazil boasts a wealth of talented developers, yet the English language barrier often limits their global visibility and opportunities. Proficiency in English is a crucial skill that unlocks access to a vast amount of content and international career prospects, especially for developers.

## Project Goal

The goal of Bolhadev.chat is to create a safe and supportive environment where members of "BolhaDev" can practice and improve their English communication skills. This project aims to bridge the language gap, allowing Brazilian developers to showcase their full potential on the global stage.

## Technology

Bolhadev.chat is designed to be cost-effective, ensuring it remains free for all users. By leveraging P2P (peer-to-peer) connections, users can connect directly, allowing us to support numerous practice rooms simultaneously without incurring significant server costs.
